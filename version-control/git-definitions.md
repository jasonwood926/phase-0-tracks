# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to make and save changes made on a repository. It is useful because many people can make changes to a master file remotely and merge them with the master once the edits are complete. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a version or set of edits that will eventually be merged into the master when completed. You would use one to edit the master files seperate from tampering with the actual master version.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save and a comment used to keep edits made and describe what has changed. A good commit message is specific and concise.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is what occurs when edits made on a branch conflict with the master code or files you're trying to merge it to.
