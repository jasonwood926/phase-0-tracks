-programming algorithm for elevator use for robot
-move forward into elevator
-scan for keypad and move within less than arms reach of keypad
-ask the user which floor they would like to go to
-take an integer input for floor number
-press the number button corresponding to the floor the user says
-say "ok going to #{floor} floor"
-after elevator stops moving says "welcome to floor #{floor}"


-programming algorithm for plant care drone
-uses map algorithm to determine space/dimensions of room
-detects moisture levels in soil for necessary watering
-if water levels are low or depleted, fills drone reservoir with needed water volume and flies to plant with deficiency
-repeats until all plants are properly watered
-detects nutrient levels in soil for necessary fertilizing
-if nutrient levels are low or depleted fills drone reservoir with needed nutrient mixture and flies to plant with deficiency
- repeats until all plants have proper nutrient levels
-flies back to charger.
